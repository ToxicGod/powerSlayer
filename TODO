Locations (We will need to come to a agreement as some monsters have multiple locations).
Traveling (Walking/Teleporting) (Currently being worked on by jkeech (MrSneaky))
Slayer masters (There is currently only two included)
Universal fighter (Needs to cater for starters and finishers)
Options/GUI (A Jframe or paint? Decide on a list of options...)
Anti-ban (Is it really needed? or could it be included in the fighter)
Banking (Many things are needed for this, also other banks need to be added)
Paint (Currently being worked on by Debauchery)
Drops (We need a system to find drops and options to include drops)
